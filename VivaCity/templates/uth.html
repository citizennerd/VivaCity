				<p>
				In the last year there has been a lot of talking about the smart city concept. 
				Big vendors have come to offer their solutions to the governance and the municipalities. 
				But the main aspect that always remains in the corner is that you can install all the magic sensors in the world,
				but i'ts not going to bring a real solution. They cost a lot and they don't really solve problems.

		<div class="slide" id="discussing">
			<div class="slide_content">
				<p>With a few friends we started analyzing open data and Linked Open Data.</p> 
				<p>The first approach has a very liquid structure if it has a structure at all,
				while the second approache has a very structured approach (too structured, some times). 
				So we thought the real deal was in the middle</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="slide" id="point">
			<div class="slide_content">
				<p>But what was the real issue were the instruments. Socrata in the USA has created the city portal for the open data, but every information is given separately. 
				Not even the LOD approach connects the info. and the instuments are UGLY!!!</p>

			<div class="slide_content">
				<p>What was a thing that enabled users to feel emathy with the city itself? 
				It was a Game: SimCity</p>

		<div class="slide" id="data">
			<div class="slide_content">
				As the Sim City developer blog states, the first versions of SC were basically only enormous data-visualization tools with simulated data generated all the time.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="slide" id="process">
			<div class="slide_content">
				So here comes VivaCity: A sim-city-esque interface to a complex data-model that fetches more or less real-time data from the remote data-providers and enables the user to "live" the data.
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="slide" id="github">
			<div class="slide_content">
				Oh, and because I want the project to live and to be used and evolved, you are welcome to Fork it and add new data-providers or new visualization methods or anything!!!
